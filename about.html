            <h1>We are the world's largest university</h1>
            <p>There are 3 Eduford colleges, which are financially independent and self-governing, but relate to the 
                central University in a kind of federal system. There are also six permanent private halls, which are 
                similar to colleges except that they tend to be smaller, and were founded by particular Christian 
                denominations. The colleges and halls are close academic communities, which bring together students and 
                researchers from different disciplines, cultures and countries. This helps to foster the outstanding 
                research achievement that has made Eduford a leader in so many fields.<br>

                The colleges and the University work together to organise teaching and research, and many staff 
                at Eduford will hold both a college and a University post.<br>
                
                If you are interested in undergraduate study at Eduford, please consult our information on colleges for 
                prospective undergraduates.</p>
